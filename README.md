This is a new implementation of [OneSDK for Node.js](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk-js) using WebAssembly under the hood. Which allows us to give users OneSDK in their favorite language.

For more details about Superface, visit [How it Works](https://superface.ai/how-it-works) and [Get Started](https://superface.ai/docs/getting-started).

## Try it out

A simple demonstration can be run with `./examples/run.sh node [CORE_MODE=default|docker|lax]`. It builds the entire project and Node.js host, then runs the example.

This will require to have Development requirements installed. In case of building the core in Docker `node` and `yarn` are still required.

### Environment variables

The OneSDK uses these environment variables:
* `ONESDK_LOG=warn` - controls the level of logging intended for users. Set to `trace` to log everything intended for users. See [tracing_subscriber directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives) for full syntax.
* `ONESDK_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:8321` - Superface registry base URL
* `ONESDK_CONFIG_CACHE_DURATION=3600` - duration in seconds of how long to cache documents (profiles, maps, providers) before downloading or reading them from the file system again
* `ONESDK_CONFIG_DEV_DUMP_BUFFER_SIZE=1048576` - size of the developer log dump ring buffer
* `ONESDK_DEV_LOG=off` - controls the level of logging intended for developers. Set to `trace` to see everything that is logged, including user log and metrics. See [tracing_subscriber directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives) for full syntax.
* `ONESDK_REPLACE_MAP_STDLIB=` - path to replacement map stdlib, intended for development only, may be removed at any time
