OneSDK is a universal API client which provides an unparalleled developer experience for every HTTP API. It enhances resiliency to API changes, and comes with built-in integration monitoring and provider failover.

## Install

To install OneSDK into a Node.js project, run:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk@alpha
```

## Usage

1. Pick use-case:

    Use-cases can be discovered in [Superface catalog](https://superface.ai/catalog) or in [Station](https://github.com/superfaceai/station/tree/main_wasm) respository.

    **ðŸš§ WASM powered OneSDK is newly using JavaScript to implement use-cases and not all were migrated yet ðŸš§**

2. Use in your code:

    OneSDK is using [EcmaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules). More on using ES modules is well described in [Pure ESM Package](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) guide.

    ```js
    import { SuperfaceClient } from '@superfaceai/one-sdk';

    const client = new SuperfaceClient();

    async function main() {
      const profile = await client.getProfile({ id: '<profileName>', version: '<profileVersion>'});

      const result = await profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>').perform({
        // Input parameters as defined in profile:
        '<key>': '<value>'
      },
      {
        provider: '<providerName>',
        parameters: {
          // Provider specific integration parameters:
          '<integrationParameterName>': '<integrationParameterValue>'
        },
        security: {
          // Provider specific security values:
          '<securityValueId>': {
            // Security values as described in provider or on profile page
          }
        }
      });

      console.log(result.unwrap());
    }

    main();
    ```

If you are missing a use case, [let us know](#support)! You can also always [add your own use-case or API provider](https://superface.ai/docs/guides/how-to-create).

## Todos & limitations

The next-gen OneSDK is still in alpha stage and several features are not yet implemented. We welcome any and all feedback. The current limitations include:

- OneSDK Client can't be instantiated in the global scope
  - We discovered Cloudflare is not allowing synchronisation between requests. We need to make sure, that two different requests are not accessing OneSDK Core at the same time. [The problem](https://zuplo.com/blog/the-script-will-never-generate-a-response-on-cloudflare-workers).
 
- Build-time integrations only
  - Currently the maps (integration glue) needs to be bundled with the worker at the build time
  - Future OneSDK will be fetching the maps at the runtime to enable dynamic healing and recovery

- Integrations monitoring won't work
  - Metrics are not yet send to Registry, so project dashboard will reamin empty.

### Cloudflare Workers specific

- The compiled WASM OneSDK is hitting the 1MB limit of the Cloudflare workers free tier
